# HackOH5_2017
[Google Doc writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TjKVKBu6LDsjV9uSEwWJpwbnE86Kui_WZRLqSh6cweA/edit?usp=sharing)

This project was created for HackOH5, a hackathon based around newspaper data from the Ohio5 colleges.

To set up data to use with Tensor Board, run either createTSVs.py to convert all articles for all schools for all years, or createTSVs_search.py to filter by year and school.
This requires the newspaper data in JSON format. Output will be in the folder TSVs
